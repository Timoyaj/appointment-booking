# Dispatch — stage 2

@coordinator — this is the whole task. Nothing outside this brief is context for you or for the
seats you dispatch to.

## Scope

Deliver `stage-2/`: a complete, buildable service that answers every Stage 2 requirement in the
specification pasted at the end of this brief, and that still answers every Stage 1 requirement.

`stage-2/` is `stage-1/` carried forward plus Stage 2. Two things are added: the product in a
browser, and tables that can be combined for one party. Everything already delivered keeps working
unchanged except where the specification below amends it.

## What to deliver

- `stage-2/Dockerfile` — builds the service from a clean context.
- `stage-2/RUN.md` — the exact commands a reviewer follows to build it, run it, and see it work.
- `stage-2/requirements.txt` — runtime dependencies, pinned.
- the source, the browser UI, and the stage's own tests.
- `stage-2/README.md` — the design, plus every judgment call the specification did not settle:
  the question, the reading chosen, and why.

The folder must serve the API and the UI from one process on one port. The browser must reach the
API through the same origin it was loaded from.

## What not to do

- Do not touch `stage-1/`. It is delivered and frozen.
- Do not answer any Stage 3 or Stage 4 requirement early. A folder that also passes the next
  stage's whole suite claims nothing. In particular: no availability explanations, no reservation
  history, no published policies or accepted terms, no recurring reservations, no table-closure
  replans.
- Do not write code to the shipped checks. They are not in this repository and must not be added to
  it. Build to the specification.
- Do not put a `.git` directory inside the stage folder.
- Do not add a feature the specification does not ask for.

## Evidence to report back

1. The stage's own suite, run in full, with the count.
2. The shipped Stage 1 checks and the shipped Stage 2 checks, run against the live service, with
   both counts.
3. A manual browser pass, described step by step: sign up, sign in, find a slot, book it, read the
   confirmation, look the booking up, cancel it — and the same for a combined pair of tables.
4. The same booking flow at 375 px wide.
5. The retry behaviour observed by hand: a booking submitted twice with one key, and a booking whose
   response is lost and then retried.
6. The list of judgment calls added to `stage-2/README.md`.

## Where the specification leaves room

When the specification does not settle a question, choose the reading a careful reader could defend,
write it into `stage-2/README.md`, and keep going. Do not stop the room to ask.

## Requirements — Stage 2 specification, verbatim

# Tablekeeper — Stage 2: online booking and combined tables

The stage-1 requirements continue to apply, with the additions below. Numbered section
references such as §5 and §7 refer to `stage-1.md`.

Diners can search, book and manage reservations in a browser. Restaurants can offer
approved pairs of tables for larger parties.

The following screens must be reachable by URL. Other screens must be reachable through
the UI. Server-side and client-side rendering are both permitted.

| Route | Screen |
|---|---|
| `/` | Search and availability grid |
| `/signup` | Signup |
| `/login` | Login |
| `/lookup` | Look up a reservation by reference |

A screen route returns HTML; §3.4's `application/json` convention is about the API, and does
not govern the routes in the table above.

## Competing clients and uncertain outcomes

The UI must handle responses arriving out of order and connections failing after submission.

- If search A starts before search B but finishes after it, the grid, table labels and
  booking form must describe B. A late response must not restore A's results.
- If another client takes a table after the form opens, a `409 table_unavailable` response
  shows `booking-error` and refreshes availability. Preserve the selected form and its
  inputs so the diner can change their choice. Do not show a confirmation for that attempt.
- If a booking response is lost, including after the booking commits, show nonempty
  `booking-uncertain` text, without `booking-error` or a new confirmation. The unchanged
  form must retry with the same idempotency key and body. A successful retry removes the
  uncertainty/error elements and shows the original reference. A confirmed rejection
  uses `booking-error`.

These rules apply to combination bookings too. No background polling, live updates,
cross-tab storage synchronization, or recovery across a page reload is required. The server
remains authoritative; the browser must not manufacture a successful result from cached data.

The UI must expose the `data-testid` attributes listed below for integration testing.
Additional elements are permitted, and the visual implementation is the team's choice subject
to the product-quality requirements below.

## Product and visual direction

The browser experience must feel like a coherent, presentation-ready restaurant product, not a
test harness with controls attached. Aim for a warm, confident hospitality character. The search,
availability and booking flow should have an obvious visual hierarchy; a diner should be able to
scan dates, times, party size and table choices without having to interpret raw API data. Combined
tables should read as intentional seating options, not as concatenated technical identifiers.

Use a consistent visual system for typography, spacing, colour, controls and feedback. Primary
actions must be easy to identify. Available, unavailable, selected, loading, successful, refused
and uncertain states must be visually distinct as well as satisfying the behavioural requirements
below. Use human-readable restaurant and table labels prominently; expose technical identifiers
only where they help the user.

The required flows must remain clear and usable at a 375 CSS-pixel viewport and at conventional
desktop widths, without horizontal page scrolling. Inputs need visible labels, keyboard focus must
be apparent, and text and controls need sufficient contrast. Provide considered empty, loading and
error states, and keep navigation consistent across the required routes. A custom illustration,
brand asset or exact visual match to a reference is not required.

## Signup and login

| `data-testid` | Element |
|---|---|
| `signup-email`, `signup-password`, `signup-display-name` | Inputs |
| `signup-submit` | Button |
| `login-email`, `login-password`, `login-submit` | Inputs and button |
| `auth-error` | Error message. Present only when there is one |
| `current-user` | Visible on every screen when signed in. Text contains the display name |
| `logout-button` | Button |

## Search and availability grid — `/`

| `data-testid` | Element |
|---|---|
| `restaurant-select` | Selects a restaurant. Option values are restaurant ids |
| `date-input` | Date, value `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `party-size-input` | Number |
| `search-button` | Runs the search |
| `availability-grid` | Container for the results |
| `slot-{table_id}-{HH:MM}` | One cell per table per slot, e.g. `slot-t_2-19:00` |
| `no-slots` | Shown instead of the grid when the day has no slots |

Each cell carries `data-available="true"` or `data-available="false"`. A cell is `true` exactly
when its `table_id` is in that slot's `available_table_ids` from `GET /availability` for the party
size that was searched, and `false` otherwise. Clicking an available cell
opens the booking form for that table and slot. Clicking an unavailable cell does nothing.
Booking requires a signed-in user: clicking an available cell while signed out shows `auth-error`
or navigates to `/login`, your choice.

## Booking form

| `data-testid` | Element |
|---|---|
| `booking-form` | Container |
| `booking-summary` | Text contains the table label and the local start time |
| `booking-party-size` | Number input, pre-filled from the search |
| `booking-submit` | Button |
| `booking-error` | Error message, when the booking fails |

Keep the booking form on screen after success. Submitting it again without changing a
field must return the same `confirmation-reference`, without `booking-error` or another
booking. Changing a field makes the next submission a new booking request. Retries follow §7.

## Confirmation

Shown after a successful booking.

| `data-testid` | Element |
|---|---|
| `confirmation` | Container |
| `confirmation-reference` | Text is exactly the reference, no surrounding words |
| `confirmation-details` | Text contains the restaurant name, table label and local start time |

## Lookup — `/lookup`

| `data-testid` | Element |
|---|---|
| `lookup-reference-input`, `lookup-submit` | Input and button |
| `reservation-detail` | Container, shown when found |
| `reservation-status` | Text is exactly `confirmed` or `cancelled` |
| `reservation-cancel-button` | Cancels. Absent once cancelled |
| `reservation-error` | Shown when not found, or when a cancel is refused |

## Existing clients after an upgrade

A stage-2 service must accept an export produced by the same team's stage-1 service. A
browser signed in before that export/import upgrade must remain signed in afterwards.
A retained booking reference still works through the lookup screen. A booking whose response
was lost before export remains retryable after import with the same body and key; the UI
must recover the original confirmation. These requirements apply when import completes
between browser requests; migration during an in-flight request is not required. No page
reload or new screen is required. The form and pending retry identity must survive the upgrade.

## Combined tables

A party may book two tables that the restaurant has declared combinable. The booking
occupies both tables for its full duration.
Existing single-table request formats remain supported.

## Model

The restaurant fixture gains one field:

```json
{
  "id": "r_anker",
  "combinable": [ ["t_1", "t_2"], ["t_2", "t_3"] ],
  ...
}
```

Each entry is an unordered pair of table ids in that restaurant. **Pairs only** — never three or
more. A pair not listed cannot be combined, whatever the table sizes are. Combining is not
transitive: `[t_1,t_2]` and `[t_2,t_3]` do not make `{t_1,t_3}` bookable.

A combination's capacity is the sum of its tables' capacities.

Seeded `reservations` are `confirmed` unless they carry a `status` of `cancelled`, and may hold
either `table_id` or `table_ids`.

## API

### `GET /availability`

Slots gain `available_options`. `available_table_ids` stays exactly as it was — single tables
only.

```json
{
  "slots": [
    {
      "starts_at_local": "2026-09-24T19:00",
      "starts_at": "2026-09-24T19:00:00+02:00",
      "available_table_ids": ["t_3"],
      "available_options": [
        { "table_ids": ["t_3"], "capacity": 4 },
        { "table_ids": ["t_1", "t_2"], "capacity": 6 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`available_options` lists every single table and every declared pair with
`capacity >= party_size` and no overlapping confirmed reservation on any member. Singles first in
fixture order, then pairs in `combinable` order. `table_ids` within a pair is in `combinable`
order.

### `POST /reservations`

The body takes `table_ids` instead of `table_id`:

```json
{ "restaurant_id": "r_anker", "table_ids": ["t_1", "t_2"],
  "starts_at_local": "2026-09-24T19:00", "party_size": 6 }
```

`table_id` is still accepted and means a set of one. Sending both is 422 `validation_failed`.

Responses always carry `table_ids`. They also carry `table_id` **when the set has exactly one
member**, and omit it otherwise.

| Case | Response |
|---|---|
| The pair is not in `combinable` | 422 `combination_not_allowed` |
| More than two tables | 422 `combination_not_allowed` |
| Any table in the set is taken for an overlapping interval | 409 `table_unavailable` |
| `party_size` exceeds the combination's summed capacity | 422 `party_exceeds_capacity` |
| Duplicate table id in the set | 422 `validation_failed` |

`PATCH /reservations/{reference}` accepts `table_ids` under the same rules. Cancelling frees every
table in the set.

## UI

The availability grid gains combination cells, shown when a declared pair is available for the
searched party size:

| `data-testid` | Element |
|---|---|
| `slot-{t_a}+{t_b}-{HH:MM}` | A combination cell, e.g. `slot-t_1+t_2-19:00`. Ids in `combinable` order. Carries `data-available` like a single cell |
| `confirmation-tables` | Text contains every table label in the reservation |
| `reservation-tables` | On the lookup screen. Same |

`booking-summary` must name every table in the selection. A single-table booking's cell testid,
confirmation and lookup are unchanged.

Atomic reservation moves from stage 1 also accept `table_ids` per move. No table may
belong to overlapping resulting bookings. The existing browser recovery and original-receipt
requirements also apply to combined-table bookings.

## Concurrent bookings and amendments

Concurrent requests must produce the same results as executing them one at a time in some
order, and the requirements above hold at every read.
